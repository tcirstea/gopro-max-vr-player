# Verification — 2026-10-28

## Passed

- `npm test`: **24/24 tests**, Node 24.22.1.
- `node --check` for every `src/*.js` module.
- Metadata/parser tests: single/dual tracks, native detection, codecs/dimensions, media-payload skipping, malformed/truncated/extended/zero-sized boxes, metadata limits and safe time formatting.
- Native tests: sample offsets/timestamps, codec configuration strings, invalid offsets/dimensions/reordered timestamps, **mocked** paired decode, duration/seek behavior, frame cleanup, unsupported-codec and partial-configuration failure, eight-sample-per-stream backpressure.
- Projection tests: known templates, face/track rotations, overlap coordinates/weights, sphere-wide bounds, invalid rays and asymmetric projection-matrix inversion.
- Source review found no runtime fetch/upload path or CDN dependency. CSP disables network connections and limits browser video media to Blob URLs.

No camera recordings or derived previews are included in the repository or deployed site.

## Not yet verified

- Actual WebCodecs HEVC decoding and sustained simultaneous two-decoder performance in a browser.
- WebGL shader compilation/pixels, full-resolution native rendering, orientation/seam quality during playback.
- Browser play/pause, seeking, fullscreen, source switching and mobile/touch layout/interaction.
- Actual immersive WebXR sessions, per-eye output, controllers and session lifecycle on a headset.

Browser QA was attempted. Workspace Chromium failed before loading the page because the sandbox denied socket creation. An escalated launch failed during sandbox setup with a read-only filesystem error. The connected browser could not reach the workspace static server. These are test-environment failures, not passing UI checks. Automated unit tests use mocked decoders and cannot establish actual hardware compatibility.

## Remaining implementation limits

Native audio, ambisonics, gyro stabilization, horizon leveling and optical-flow seam correction are absent. Duplicated-overlap blending is implemented. Native demux currently accepts 4096×1344 paired HEVC tracks and rejects reordered timestamps and nonzero edit offsets; MAX2 is not validated. The 2272×736 renderer template is not yet enabled through native demux.

## Browser acceptance checks

1. Open the generated demo; check graphics errors, drag/arrows/zoom/reset, narrow-screen layout and touch interaction.
2. Open suitable original MAX test media on a HEVC-capable browser. Verify both decoders, orientation, overlap seams and motion against a trusted export.
3. Play/pause, seek while paused/playing, replay after end, seek rapidly, and switch between native/equirectangular/demo repeatedly. Ensure old events and frames do not affect the newer source.
4. Test corrupt/unsupported files, unavailable WebCodecs/HEVC, partial decoder failure, GPU limits and WebGL context loss.
5. Test equirectangular playback and audio/mute independently; native playback should remain clearly silent.
6. Enter/exit fullscreen and immersive WebXR, including interruption and reentry; validate both eyes and fixed-position panorama behavior on a physical headset.
7. Verify the deployed commit and live repository-subpath URL separately. This local verification record does not certify a particular GitHub Actions run or deployment.
